# FVTT-Chat-Message-Accessibility-Indicators (forked from [source](https://github.com/schultzcole/FVTT-Chat-Message-Accessibility-Indicators) which is archived and not marked as compatible)

Install by using manifest link:

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itamarcu/FVTT-Chat-Message-Accessibility-Indicators/master/module.json`

Adds a textual tag to chat messages to easily identify whether the message is a whisper, blind roll, or self roll.

## Compatibility

I can't make any promises of compatibility with modules that do custom roll cards. It should fall back to labeling private gm roll and blind roll chat cards as whispers in the case of weirdness.
